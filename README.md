## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I really struggled with the Javascript functionalty of when a number has already been clicked and you click another number, the first number's colour reverts to the original and the new clicked number changes colour to orange.

After a few hours of trying to search Google, I asked ChatGPT which gave me some working code. I then modified it to fit my use case.

The rest of the Javascript was relatively easy to implement.

I found trying to reduce the size of the provided SVG difficult and in the end I need to apply a scaleing factor instead of explicitly setting the width and height. This is not pixel perfect but it works.

### Continued development

I need to work on my CSS Grid as tried this for a few parts and could not get the functionality to work as I would have liked.
As always when trying Grid I find it easier to implement the solution in Flexbox.
